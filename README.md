# Heart attack Prediction üéØ


## We have trained and tested a ML Model that trains on a set of data.We created the frontend using simple HTML and backend using Python.We used the Flask for enabling the frontend to send data and receive¬†predictions.The users can input the set of values like age,gender,cholestrol level etc and the model predicts whether the inputs indicate heart attack or not.

### Project Description
We created the frontend using simple HTML and backend using Python.We used the Flask for enabling the frontend to send data and receive¬†predictions.The users can input the set of values like age,gender,cholestrol level etc and the model predicts whether the inputs indicate heart attack or not.

### The Problem statement
We are aiming to support medical staffs in easily predicting cases for heart attack by a set of valid medical conditions.

### The Solution
We look forward to solve it using a ML Model that has been trained with various dataset inputs so that it get trained to predict our inputs correctly.
